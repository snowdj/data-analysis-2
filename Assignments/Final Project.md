# Final Project
#### DDL: Jan 20, 2020

---

The final project is an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned in class to a problem of your interest. The project can be either an empirical analysis or a methodology (theoretical) paper.

#### Empirical Analysis
Analyze an economic problem using real data and methods related to this course. If you are coming to this course with a specific research interest (e.g., corporate finance) and an on-going project (e.g., your thesis), we'd love to see you apply the methods you have learned to your research.

#### Methodology (Theoretical) Paper
You can make a methodological contribution by proposing *new* statistical algorithms or econometric models to solve problems of interest. You can demonstrate the effectiveness of your proposed method(s) by simulation - theoretical proof of asymptotic properties is welcome but certainly not required. Note, however, you cannot write a paper that simply explains or demonstrates existing methods.

To inspire ideas, you might want to look at recent publications from top Economics/Stat/CS journals and conferences (e.g., AER, Econometrica, JPE, QJE, etc.)

## Collaboration Policy
Up to **three** people can collaborate on the final project and submit a single final paper. You are highly encouraged to work together.

Note, however, just like what we do for homework assignments, the final project score will be adjusted in the end to reflect your proper academic level and contribution. This roughly means that the more co-authors a project has, the higher the expected quality will be.

## Requirements
- If you are doing empirical analysis, the topic should be related to applied microeconomics, including labor economics, industrial organization, international trade, corporate finance, etc. You should *not* do a pure data science/machine learning project (e.g., predicting heart disease).
- Since this is not a macro- or financial econometrics course, your project should *not* be time-series analysis of macro or financial data - in general, microeconomic applications involve cross-sectional or panel data.
- You are welcome to research topics or use methods not covered in this course. Want to do reinforcement learning? Dynamic games? Bayesian data analysis? All are welcome as long as related to microeconomic appliccations.

## Format
#### Paper
You should submit a paper in `pdf` format, preferably written in LaTex. There are no formal page or word count requirement. However, it is expected that the paper should be formatted like a formal research paper and should be complete enough to be submittable to academic conferences.

It is important that you follow acacemic paper formatting standards, including Tables and Figures formatting, numbering, reference style, etc. See the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html). Also click [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/templates) for LaTeX templates and formatting guidelines for submission to the AEA journals.

In general, your paper could include the following sections:

- **Abstract**: the abstract should be short and succinct. No more than 300 words.
- **Introduction**
- **Literature Review**: this should be one of the most important parts of your paper. You should try to summarize the relevant literature as well as possible. The summary should have clear logic on how your work fit into the literature and what your contribution is, i.e. it is *not* enough to simply list a number of relevant papers and summarize their content, you *must* provide an overview of how the papers are related to each other and to your own work. In addition, the quality of the literature that you survey is also important. Try to review only important working papers and papers recently published in top Economic, Statistics, or CS journal. Do not include papers published in obscure journals.
- **Model/Methods**
- **Data** (if you are doing empirical analysis): Describe the data you are working with. What type of data is it? Where did it come from? Did you have to do any preprocessing to use this data in your project? Conduct descriptive analysis and use visualization techniques to describe your data.
- **Results**
- **Conclusion**

note: you don't necessarily have to organize your paper using these sections (or in their above-listed order). This is a guideline.

#### Supplementary materials
In addition to submitting a final paper, you should also submit your data and codes as supplementary materials (you can submit them on Moodle or put them in your github repo and supply a link).

If you use non-public confidential data and do not wish to share them, however, it is okay that you do not submit them. In this case, you should try your best to describe the data well in your paper.

## Evaluation
Evaluation will be based on (1) difficulty; (2) originality; (3) relevance to course topic and materials; (4) writing quality (including lit review quality); (5) formatting quality.

---

## Academic Integrity
- You should *not* turn in the same project that you have done for other classes. However, it is okay for your project to build on work you have done prior to taking this course. For example, you may use data that you have already processed for your own research.
- Plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity. If it is found that you used sources without proper reference, you will get a zero for your final project.
