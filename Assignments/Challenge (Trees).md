# Homework Challenge (2 Extra Points)

Decision trees are piecewise constant models that use data to determine the number of location of cut points.

But can we do the same for piecewise linear or higher order polynomial models as well?

Challenge: design and implement a piecewise linear or higher order polynomial decision tree. Feel free to use simulated data to demonstrate the effectiveness of your method.
